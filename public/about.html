<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Maverick Eru, a budding creative with a passion for learning and growth. As an introvert, I spend most of my free time watching anime and making edits.</p>
<p>I'm currently developing my skills in certain areas like video editing, music, writing and of course, web development and I'm excited to share my progress with you. This portfolio is a collection of my earlier HTML projects and I'm eager to learn from feedback and continue improving.</p>
